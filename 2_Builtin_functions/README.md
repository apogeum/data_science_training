* unless otherwise specified, please execute each instruction in a new cell
1. execute `max(2,1,5,4,3)`
* question: what do you think `max()` function does?
2. execute `help(max)`
* question: try to guess a function that finds minimum of `2,1,5,4,3`
3. verify your guess with the use of `help()` function
4. execute `abs(10)`
5. execute `abs(-10)`
6. execute `abs(0)`
7. try to guess what `abs()` is doing and then use `help()` to confirm
8. execute `pow(2,3)`
9. execute `pow(3,2)`
* question: how would you use `pow()` to calculate square root of 1089?
10. an inverse of number n is 1/n. Express inverse of 5 using only `pow()` function.
* hint: 1/x = x<sup>-1</sup>
11. execute `round(2)`
12. execute `round(2.2)`
13. execute `round(2.5)`
14. execute `round(2.6)`
15. execute `round(0.123456789, 1)`
16. execute `round(0.123456789, 2)`
* question: how would you round the number `0.123456789` to 6 decimal places?
17. execute `str(10)`
* note: words enclosed in `"double quotes"` represent literals(values without name) of type String
18. execute `str(10.0)`
19. try to guess what `str()` is doing and then use `help()` to confirm
20. execute `int("10")`
* note: whole numbers written without period `.` sign represent literals of type Int
21. execute `int("10.0")`
* question: why do we see the exception?
22. execute `float("10")`
* note: numbers written with period `.` separating whole and fractional part represent literals of type Float
23. execute `float("10.1")`
24. execute `float("1O")`
* question: why do we see the exception?
25. execute `bool("True")
* note: True and False (without quotations) are python literals to express 2 possible states of type *bool*
26. execute `bool("true")`
27. execute `bool("false")`
* note: bool is a function to transform other types to boolean. It has certain assumptions on what does it mean that some type is false or true. Those assumptions are not always intuitive, so let us test them.
28. try to apply `bool()` function to the following values: `" ", "", 1, -1, 0, 1.1, -1.1, 0.0, None`
29. execute `type(None)`
* note `None` is a python literal for a very special type called NoneType. This type only has one valid value: `None`. You will find out about usefulness of this type in further exercises.
