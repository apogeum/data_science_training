* unless otherwise specified, please execute each instruction in a new cell
1. execute `max(2,1,5,4,3)`
* question: what do you think `max()` function does?
2. execute `help(max)`
* question: try to guess a function that finds minimum of `2,1,5,4,3`
3. verify your guess with the use of `help()` function
4. execute `abs(10)`
5. execute `abs(-10)`
6. execute `abs(0)`
7. try to guess what `abs()` is doing and then use `help()` to confirm
8. execute `pow(2,3)`
9. execute `pow(3,2)`
question: how would you use `pow()` to calculate square root of 1089?
10. an inverse of number n is 1/n. Express inverse of 5 using only `pow()` function.
* hint: 1/x = x<sup>-1</sup>
11. execute `round(2)`
12. execute `round(2.2)`
13. execute `round(2.5)`
14. execute `round(2.6)`
15. execute `round(0.123456789, 1)`
16. execute `round(0.123456789, 2)`
question: round the number `0.123456789` to 6 decimal places
17. execute `str(10)`
18. execute `str(10.0)`
19. try to guess what `str()` is doing and then use `help()` to confirm
20. execute `int("10")
